We can identify a variable’s type by looking at the quotation marks: 
Strings consist of strings of letters, so they must be enclosed in quotation marks; while integers are not.

If we give a variable an illegal name, we will get SyntaxError. These are the cases where variable names are invalid:
- The name does not begin with a letter or an underscore (_). Example: 97PhanAnh
- The name contains special characters. Example: abc%
- The name is identified as a keyword in Python. Example: def
