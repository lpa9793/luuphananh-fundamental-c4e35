1. We can identify a variable’s type by looking at the quotation marks: 
Strings consist of strings of letters, so they must be enclosed in quotation marks; while integers are not.

If we give a variable an illegal name, we will get SyntaxError. These are the cases where variable names are invalid:
- The name does not begin with a letter or an underscore (_). Example: 97PhanAnh
- The name contains special characters. Example: abc%
- The name is identified as a keyword in Python. Example: def


# Calculates the area of a circle

a=int(input("Radius? "))
Area=a**2*3.14
print("Area =",Area)

# Converts Celsius (0C) into Fahrenheit (0F)

t=int(input("Enter the temperature in Celsius? "))
f=t*1.8+32
t=str(t)
f=str(f)
print(t,"(C) = ",f,"(F)")
